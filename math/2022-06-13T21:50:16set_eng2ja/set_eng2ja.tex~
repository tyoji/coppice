\textbf{Theorem 1.3.5}
A set $S$ is closed if and only if no point of $S^c$ is a limit point of $S$.

\textbf{定理 1.3.5}
集合$S$が閉であるとは$S$の極限点が補集合$S^c$に存在しない時に限って言う。

「if and only if」とは
前後が必要十分である時に使う。
この場合、閉集合であることと補集合に極限点がないことを指す。


極限点（きょくげんてん、英: limit point）とは
集積点（しゅうせきてん、英: accumulation point）の事。

\textbf{Proof}
Suppose that $S$ is closed and $x_0\in S^c$.
Since $S^c$ is open, there is a neighborhood of $x_0$ that is contained in $S^c$
and therefore contains no points of $S$.
Hence, $x_0$ connot be a limit point of $S$.
For the converse, if no point of $S^c$ is a limit point of $S$
then every point in $S^c$ must have a neighborhood contained in $S^c$.
Therefore, $S^c$ is open and $S$ is closed.

Theorem 1.3.5 is usually stated as follows.

\textbf{Corollary 1.3.6}
A set is closed if and only if it contains all its limit points.

Theorem 1.3.5 and Corollary 1.3.6 are equivalent.
However, we stated the theorem as we did because students sometimes incorrectly conclude
 from the corollary that a closed set must have limit points.
The corollary does not say this.
If $S$ has no limit points,
then the set of limit points is empty and therefore contained in $S$.
Hence, a set with no limit points is closed according to the corollary,
in agreement with Theorem 1.3.5.
For example, any finite set is closed.
More generally, $S$ is closed if there is a $\delta>0$ such $| x-y | \geq \delta$
for every pair $\{x,y\}$ of distinct points in $S$.
